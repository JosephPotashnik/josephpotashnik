Analytically driven developer with a proven track record of quickly mastering new technologies and knowledge domains. Self-motivated learner who thrives in dynamic environments requiring critical thinking, creative problem-solving, and with a deep appreciation for the theoretical aspects of problems. Experienced back-end developer (.NET) currently expanding to full-stack expertise.

<li>ðŸ”­ Current Project: I am working on Unsupervised Grammar Induction. You can get a small preview of the theoretical work <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15321">here</a>. The code (C#) is to be released to the public at a later stage.</li>
<li>ðŸš€ Check out my work on Density-based Clustering, which has a <a href="http://dp-clustering.s3-website.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/">live version</a> available (hosted on Amazon EC2 machine). 
  I also developed an Earley Parser, a top-down parser capable of parsing any context-free grammar in cubic time. An UI is available <a href=https://cosmic-marshmallow-19b8ab.netlify.app/"> here </a> (UI hosted on netlify, backend hosted on Render.com). Both projects use React as their front-end, ASP.NET as their RESTful API entry points, and a .NET library (C# 8) availabe via NuGET. See Pinned Projects. </li>
<li>ðŸŒ± Learning: Currently deepening my knowledge in Full-stack Development, AI API Engineering, and DevOps.</li>
<li>ðŸŽ§ I wear two cochlear implants.</li>
